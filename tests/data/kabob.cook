You will need 1-inch metal #skewers{}.

-- For best results the meat should be fresh (not previously frozen) and at room temperature.

Finely chop the @onion{2%pcs} pieces in a food processor until very juicy. Place a #fine metal mesh{} over a bowl and strain the processed onion by pressing it with a spatula. Discard the juice.

Add the remaining onion pulp to a medium bowl.

Add the @ground beef{1/2%kg} (80-85% lean) and @lamb{1/2%kg} (80-85% lean).

-- If too thick put it thru grinder multiple times to make it smooth

Add minced @garlic{3%gloves}, @salt{1%tsp}, @sumac{1%tsp}, @black pepper{1/2%tsp}, @turmeric{1/2%tsp} and @egg{1%pcs} to the bowl. 

Knead all of the ingredients for several minutes until the mixture is paste like and sticks together without falling apart.

Fill up a small bowl with tap @water, this is for wetting your fingers so the meat does not stick to them when you are making the kabobs.

Divide the meat into 10 equal balls.

Get one of the balls of meat in the palm of your hand, place the #skewer on top of it and squeeze the meat around the #skewer. Once you make sure that meat is not going to fall off, start squeezing it from top to bottom and cover the middle section of the skewer. Leave the top and bottom of the skewer clear. Wet your fingers with the tap water and keep squeezing and spreading the meat evenly around the skewer. The meat should be about Â½ inch thick all around the skewer.

Set the #skewer gently on a shallow baking sheet with sides, so the meat does not touch the floor of the baking sheet. Continue making the rest of the kabobs. At this point the uncooked kabobs can sit over the counter while you get the grill ready.

Place as many kabob #skewers as you can fit on the grill, leave some space between them. As soon as you are done arranging all the #skewers, start turning the first #skewer and keep turning the rest in the order that you have placed them on the grill. The reason for this quick turning is to cook both sides of the kabobs for a short time so the meat cooks and firms up all around and does not fall off the skewer. Do not overcook the kabobs because they are thin and tend to dry out. Turn the kabobs again until you get the doneness you desire. The kabobs should have a nice grilled color on the outside and no longer pink inside, but still very juicy.

When the kabobs are ready, remove them from the heat and into a container lined with a large aluminum foil. Keep the kabobs covered with the foil until ready to serve.

To serve, use a piece of flat bread (Sangak, soft lavash, or pita bread) larger than the palm of your hand. Start at the end with handle, grab the kabob and slide it off the #skewer onto the serving platter. This is the easiest and safest way to pull the kabobs off the skewer. The flavorful kabob juices make the bread so delicious that everyone will want a piece.

Brush melted @butter over the kabobs.
